# EXTRA CREDIT Improve the Battle.py script. (2 pts)
# The algorithm in the Battle.py script is pretty lame.
# (Team Rocket is NOT known for its skills in evaluating Pokemon.)
# Improve it and commit the changes to this repository.
# Make sure to point out to your TA that you have improved it, so they can
# verify it and give you the extra point.
